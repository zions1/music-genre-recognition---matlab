Music Genre Recognition

Project title: 
Music genre recognition using the machine learning technology.

Primary project aim: 
Develop an application for music genre recognition using the artificial neural network approach.

Brief description of project:
The project aim is to create and develop an application for recognition of music genres. The application is expected to recognize the music genre for input sounds.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this application is GTZAN dataseet(http://marsyasweb.appspot.com/download/data_sets/).
The dataset consists of 1000 audio tracks each 30 seconds long. It contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks. The tracks are all 22,050 Hz Mono 16-bit audio files in .wav format.

Tha application allows to read data in different format type:
-> uncompressed format - .au and .wav
-> lossless compression format - .flac
-> lossy compression format - .ogg (in future .mp3)
